Before starting Labwork-1, I watched the instructional videos and read the mate-rials provided in Module 1, which helped me prepare. Initially, I thought the setup would be challenging, especially after reading Rathod's (2023) instructions for Labwork-1. However, once I started working, the process of setting up the mobile app development environment went quickly and well.
To set up the environment, I followed the step-by-step guide to install NodeJS, Java JDK17, and Ionic App. The only minor issue I faced was finding the correct JDK environment variable, but I was able to resolve it after figuring out it was in the path variable under the Python value. After that, the setup process continued without any major issues, including the creation of a simple Ionic app, although the react-tab app didn’t save because I attempted to connect to GitHub separate-ly.
My experience setting up the mobile app development environment was generally smooth, with only a few minor challenges. These were easily manageable, so I didn’t need to consult anyone for assistance, except for a brief clarification from my teacher regarding the JDK setup instructions.
Additionally, from previous research in another course, I’ve come to understand that mobile app development presents specific challenges, particularly in terms of accessibility and user experience (UX/UI). These areas require careful considera-tion, established evaluation methods, and user testing to ensure a successful out-come.
